        <li>eggs (<strong>remove</strong> the shell first)</li>
        <li>dried parsley</li>
        <li>garlic power</li>
        <li>salt <em>n</em> peppa</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

        <li>ketchup</li>
        <li>worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>hot sauce of your choice (secret ingredient)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the meat, bread crumbs, diced onion, dried parsley,
            garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Wash your hands, ya filthy animal!</li>
        <li>Mash up the dry ingredients with your nice clean hands :)</li>
        <li>Add the egg (sans shell) to the mixture and mash up some more
            to your hearts content!</li>
        <li>Put it in the fridge for a bit. Watch 1-2 episodes of MASH.</li>
        <li> your hands again! God knows what you've touched...</li>
        <li>On a baking tray, lay down a sheet of aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Add your meaty mush to the tray.</li>
        <li>Mold and sculpt the meat into your desired shape. <strong><em>
            DO NOT</em></strong> make a snowman. I already called dibs!</li>
        <li>In a normal-sized bowl, combine all your sauce ingredents 
            in whatever ratio you think is cool.</li>
        <li>Take a... <a href="../img/foodbrush.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            food paint brush</a>??? and <em>paint</em>??? the sauce on top of
            the meatloaf.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350Â°F. At this temperature a 1 lb meatloaf will take 35 to
            45 minutes to complete. If you meatloaf weights more than one pound...
            uhh, do some math and figure it out, nerd.</li>
        <li>Remove the meatloaf <strong>with oven mits</strong>!!!</li>
        <li>Let it rest for an additional 1-2 episodes of MASH</li>
        <li>Uh oh! Now the meatloaf is cold. Reheat it the microwave I guess.</li>
    </ol>
